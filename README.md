## This is the manju_reddys slickgrid repo

I have forked this from 6pac to fix the [issue](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/issues/11). The 6pac closed the issue without proper solution. 


I will maintain this branch and add more features as I come up with new requirements and implement them. 

Find documentation and examples in [the wiki](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki) (Original author mleibman).

## Changes made in this branch

* Moved the CSS files to 'css' folder (consistence with STDs).
* Added column option `"preventClearOnEdit"` to prevent the cell content to be cleared on click ( for edit).


## Roadmap

* Add more features (nothing in my mind for now except adding few additional editors).
* Add support for less.
