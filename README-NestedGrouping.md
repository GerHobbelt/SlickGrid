Notes: Please note that this project fork is in very early stage!!!

What do we want to achieve? 
- A functional SlickGrid with nested grouping (multiple columns grouping).

What is working?
- I got it partly working with 2 levels though it only works on the first page load.
- Structure chosen seems good (arguments in array style similar to jqGrid), though enhancement/proposal are also accepted.
- Sub-totals are working but only on last level of groups (meaning the 2nd level sub-totals shows up, not the sub-total of the parent though)

What is NOT working?
- Expanding/Collapsing isn't working yet, though I am actually investigating how to do it.
- Over 2 levels deep isn't tested yet.
- Sub-totals of parent level (1st level) isn't displayed/working.
- Page count, options, etc.. isn't working properly
