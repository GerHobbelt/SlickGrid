When scrolling using the keyboard (arrow keys) slickgrid scrolls 'per page'; configure it to scroll 'per line' only.
<hr/>
Use 'sensitivity band' (number of rows) to detect when the start scrolling the grid viewport so we don't always stick the active row in the center but don't get near the edge either until we hit the very end/start of the entire grid.
<hr />
Same goes for the column (horizontal) scrolling: sensitivity band and per-column rather than jumping per column set.
